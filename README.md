# Logical Enterprise

A model to make explicit how a company works and enable the conscious use of Artificial Intelligence.

## What is Logical Enterprise

Full read: [00 - Definition of Logical Enterprise](docs/en-US/01-concept/00-definition.md).

Logical Enterprise is a model for understanding a company.

It makes explicit elements that are usually implicit, such as functions, decisions, rules, limits, and principles, organizing that knowledge in a logical and documented way so it can be understood, shared, and evolved over time.

Logical Enterprise is not a tool or a closed method.  
It operates at a conceptual level, prior to execution.

## What problem does it solve

Full read: [02 - The Problem of the Current World](docs/en-US/00-introduction/02-the-problem-of-the-current-world.md) and [03 - What Logical Enterprise Solves](docs/en-US/00-introduction/03-what-logical-enterprise-solves.md).

Companies repeatedly face problems such as:

- important decisions that are not recorded;
- knowledge concentrated in specific people;
- documentation that does not keep up with business evolution;
- conflicts between areas due to lack of clarity;
- generic and ineffective use of Artificial Intelligence.

Logical Enterprise exists to solve the central problem behind these symptoms: the lack of an explicit logical model that represents how the company really works.

## What Logical Enterprise is not

Full read: [02 - What Logical Enterprise Is Not](docs/en-US/01-concept/02-what-it-is-not.md).

Logical Enterprise is not:

- a methodology with mandatory steps;
- a specific software or tool;
- a traditional management framework;
- a system for controlling people;
- a way to replace leaders or decision-makers.

It does not eliminate business complexity, nor does it promise automatic success.

## Who it makes sense for

Full read: [07 - Adaptation by Company Type](docs/en-US/02-usage/07-adaptation-by-company-type.md).

Logical Enterprise can be applied by:

- people starting a business from scratch;
- small teams in growth;
- mid-sized companies;
- large and complex organizations.

Company size is not the determining factor.  
What matters is the need for clarity, continuity, and coherence.

## How Logical Enterprise works

Full read: [00 - Introduction to Models](docs/en-US/03-models/00-introduction.md) and [05 - Connecting the Models](docs/en-US/03-models/05-connecting-models.md).

At a high level, Logical Enterprise organizes:

- functions and responsibilities, as logical roles;
- decisions and their criteria;
- rules and limits that cannot be broken;
- living documentation that keeps up with the company’s evolution;
- continuity of reasoning over time.

These elements connect to form a coherent view of the company, accessible to people and to Artificial Intelligence.

## Using Artificial Intelligence

Full read: [03 - Why LLMs Need This](docs/en-US/01-concept/03-why-llms-need-this.md) and [04 - AI Use Playbook](docs/en-US/04-playbook/04-ai-use-playbook.md).

Logical Enterprise strengthens AI usage by providing context.

With it, AI starts to:

- understand how the company works;
- respect rules and limits;
- support decisions with more coherence;
- avoid generic or contradictory responses.

AI acts as support, not as a decision-maker.
