# When to Use Logical Enterprise

Logical Enterprise does not need to be used all the time or for everything.

It becomes especially valuable in situations where **clarity is missing** and **the risk of disconnected decisions is high**.

This document exists to help identify **when it makes sense to use Logical Enterprise** and when it is not necessary.

---

## When Logical Enterprise is needed

Logical Enterprise should be used whenever the company understanding stops being obvious.

Some clear signs are:

- decisions start to contradict each other
- discussions reappear frequently
- nobody remembers why something was decided
- new people take too long to understand the business
- AI generates inconsistent answers
- changes create unexpected side effects

When these signs appear, the problem is usually not technical. It is **lack of structural clarity**.

---

## Use in creating new products or services

Creating something new requires decisions on many fronts:

- the problem to be solved
- the target audience
- business rules
- impacts on existing products
- technical and operational constraints

Logical Enterprise helps to:

- organize that reasoning
- avoid isolated decisions
- record important choices
- maintain coherence from the start

The earlier it is used, the lower the cost of fixing errors later.

---

## Use in companies that do not formally exist yet

Even when the company is just an idea, decisions already start to be made.

Logical Enterprise helps to:

- think as a company from the start
- make explicit functions that do not yet exist
- avoid contradictory decisions at the origin
- create a solid base for growth

It does not require a large structure. It only requires **clarity of thought**.

---

## Use in companies already operating

In existing companies, Logical Enterprise helps when:

- the business grew fast
- processes were created reactively
- important decisions were implicit
- knowledge concentrated in few people
- documentation does not match reality

In these cases, it works as a way to **organize what already exists** without having to reinvent everything.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

Logical Enterprise should be used whenever AI is called for relevant decisions, such as:

- supporting decisions
- suggesting solutions
- analyzing impacts
- generating product ideas
- helping evolve systems

Without this context, AI works generically.

With Logical Enterprise, it starts to work **within the business logic**.

---

## When Logical Enterprise is not needed

Not every situation requires this level of clarity.

Logical Enterprise can be unnecessary when:

- the decision is simple and isolated
- there is no impact on other areas
- there is no risk of future repetition
- the context is completely obvious

Forcing its use in these cases can create unnecessary friction.

---

## Progressive use, not mandatory

Logical Enterprise does not need to be applied all at once.

It can start:

- with a few mapped functions
- with the most relevant decisions recorded
- with basic rules made explicit

Over time, the model evolves along with the company.

---

## In essence

Use Logical Enterprise when:

- clarity matters more than speed
- decisions need to be consistent
- context cannot be lost
- people and AI need to think together

Do not use it when that is not necessary.

Knowing **when to use** it is part of correct use.
