# How to Start Logical Enterprise

Starting Logical Enterprise does not require a specific size or a single path.

It can be built gradually or born widely documented.

The central point is not **how much** to document at the beginning, but **with what intention** and **with what clarity**.

This document exists to show how to take the first steps in a conscious way, adapted to each company's reality.

## There is no single starting point

Logical Enterprise does not impose a mandatory starting order.

It works when:

- a company decides to document everything at once, or
- a company starts in parts, as needed

Both approaches are valid.

The mistake is not documenting little or a lot. The mistake is documenting without purpose or without real use.

---

## Choose a starting point that makes sense

Although there is no single path, it is important to choose **where to start**.

That point can be:

- a product
- a service
- a specific area
- a set of recurring decisions
- or even the company as a whole

The choice should consider:

- where there is more confusion
- where decisions contradict each other
- where context gets lost
- or where the impact is greatest

---

## Make clear what is being documented

Before recording anything, it is essential to answer:

- what is being described?
- why is this being documented now?
- what problem does this documentation solve?
- who will be impacted by it?

Without these answers, documentation loses value quickly.

---

## Identify the functions involved

Regardless of scope size, it is necessary to make clear:

- which company functions are involved
- which responsibilities each function has
- which decisions belong to each one

Remember: Logical Enterprise describes **functions**, not job titles or people.

One person can perform multiple functions. That does not change the model.

---

## Record decisions, rules, and constraints

Now, record clearly:

- decisions made
- rules that must be respected
- constraints that cannot be crossed
- exceptions, when they exist
- known impacts

The record does not need to be extensive. It needs to be **understandable and reusable**.

---

## Ensure access to what was documented

Documentation that is not consulted does not fulfill its role.

Make sure that:

- information is easy to find
- involved people can consult it
- AI can use that context, when applicable

Format is secondary. Access is essential.

---

## Use Logical Enterprise as a continuous reference

Logical Enterprise is not something you write and forget.

It should be used:

- before new decisions
- when reviewing something existing
- when conflicts arise
- when involving new people or AI

This recurring use is what keeps coherence over time.

---

## Starting with or without Artificial Intelligence

Logical Enterprise works independently of AI use.

It already generates value when:

- decisions are clear
- context is not lost
- people understand each other better

When AI enters, it benefits directly from the clarity that already exists.

---

## What to avoid at the beginning (regardless of size)

Avoid:

- documenting out of obligation
- creating hard to maintain structures
- recording information with no practical use
- turning clarity into bureaucracy

If documentation gets in the way, something is wrong.

---

## In essence

Starting Logical Enterprise means:

- choosing a conscious starting point
- making clear what is being documented
- recording relevant decisions
- using that record as a real reference

The initial size is a choice. Clarity is not optional.
