# Mapping Company Functions

Mapping functions is one of the most important steps to turn Logical Enterprise into something usable day to day.

Without clear functions, decisions get confused, responsibilities overlap, and context is lost.

This document exists to show **how to identify and describe company functions in a simple, practical, and reusable way**.

## What "function" means in Logical Enterprise

In Logical Enterprise, function is not a job title, not a person, and not a label.

A function represents:

- a type of responsibility that needs to exist
- a set of decisions that must be made
- a logical role in how the company works

Examples of functions (not job titles):

- product definition
- priority decisions
- business rule validation
- quality control
- risk management

One person can perform multiple functions. Several people can perform the same function. That does not change the model.

---

## Why map functions before anything else

When functions are not clear:

- decisions become implicit
- conflicts arise from overlap
- nobody knows who decides what
- AI does not know who to "listen" to

Mapping functions solves this before it becomes an operational problem.

## How to identify real company functions

A good starting point is to observe decisions, not activities.

Ask:

- what type of decision needs to be made here?
- who is responsible for that type of decision?
- what happens if that decision does not exist?

If a decision is recurring, it points to a function.

## Start with essential functions

Every company, regardless of size, needs some basic functions.

For example:

- define what will be built (product or service)
- decide priorities
- ensure rules are respected
- evaluate business impacts
- maintain continuity over time

These functions can be concentrated in one person or distributed across several.

The important point is that they are **clear**.

---

## Describing a function in a simple way

Each function can be described by answering a few questions:

- what is the objective of this function?
- what type of decision does it make?
- which constraints must it respect?
- which other functions does it relate to?

Avoid long descriptions. Clarity matters more than detail.

---

## Functions are not static

Functions can:

- appear
- change
- split
- merge

Logical Enterprise does not require everything to be perfect. It requires that changes are **recorded**.

When a function changes, what matters is:

- making clear what changed
- recording the reason
- updating the relationships with other functions

---

## Avoid confusing function with process

Processes describe **how something is done**. Functions describe **who decides what**.

The same function can exist in several different processes.

Keeping this separation avoids excess documentation and structural confusion.

---

## Relationship between functions and decisions

Every relevant decision should be linked to a function.

If a decision:

- has no responsible function
- depends only on specific people
- changes depending on who is involved

That is a warning sign.

Logical Enterprise helps fix this by making responsibility explicit.

---

## Direct benefits of mapping functions

When functions are clear:

- decisions become faster
- conflicts decrease
- new people understand the company better
- AI responds with more coherence
- context is maintained over time

It is not bureaucracy. It is **organization of reasoning**.

---

## In essence

Mapping functions is:

- identifying real responsibilities
- separating function from person
- making decisions explicit
- creating a base for future coherence

Without clear functions, Logical Enterprise does not sustain itself.

## Next recommended reading

Now that functions are mapped, the next step is to understand **how these functions relate and in which logical order they depend on each other**.
