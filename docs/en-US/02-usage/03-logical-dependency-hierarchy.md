# Logical Dependency Hierarchy

In Logical Enterprise, hierarchy does not mean power. It means **logical dependency**.

This document exists to explain how to organize company functions according to **what needs to exist first** for the rest to make sense.

## What logical hierarchy is

Logical hierarchy answers a simple question:

> "What needs to exist first so that something else makes sense?"

It does not deal with:

- job titles
- authority
- seniority
- who reports to whom

It deals with **order of dependency**.

---

## Why hierarchy by power does not work here

Traditional hierarchies organize people. Logical Enterprise organizes **functions**.

When power hierarchy is used:

- decisions get confused with authority
- areas compete instead of collaborating
- conflicts become personal disputes
- AI does not understand which rule has priority

Logical hierarchy avoids this because it is based on necessity, not status.

---

## Logical dependency in practice

A function depends on another when it:

- needs a prior definition
- must respect constraints already established
- cannot decide without prior context

A simple example:

- you cannot prioritize without knowing **what exists**
- you cannot develop without knowing **what was defined**
- you cannot validate without knowing **which rules apply**

This order is logical and usually repeats.

## Example of a dependency chain

A generic example of logical dependency:

1. **Purpose and problem**
   - what is being created
   - which problem it solves

2. **Product or service**
   - what it is
   - what it is not

3. **Rules and constraints**
   - what can be done
   - what cannot be done

4. **Strategic decisions**
   - priorities
   - chosen paths

5. **Execution**
   - how it will be done
   - by whom
   - with which means

Each level depends on the previous. Reversing this order creates rework.

Execution depends on this hierarchy, but it is outside the scope of Logical Enterprise.

---

## Functions can be at the same level

Logical hierarchy does not mean one function per level.

Several functions can exist at the same dependency level, as long as they do not depend on each other.

The important points are:

- making clear who depends on whom
- avoiding dependency cycles
- recording exceptions when they exist

---

## Avoiding dependency cycles

A cycle happens when:

- function A depends on B
- function B depends on A

This is a sign of a definition problem.

When this happens:

- review responsibilities
- separate decisions
- make constraints clearer

Cycles confuse people and make AI inconsistent.

---

## How to use logical hierarchy day to day

Before making a decision, ask:

- does this decision depend on something that is not defined yet?
- is there a previous function that should be consulted?
- am I skipping steps due to urgency?

These simple questions avoid a large portion of problems.

---

## Direct benefits of logical hierarchy

When logical hierarchy is clear:

- decisions become more coherent
- conflicts decrease
- discussions become objective
- AI responds more consistently
- the whole remains intact

It is not control. It is **clarity of order**.

---

## In essence

Logical hierarchy is:

- order of dependency
- clarity about what comes first
- separation between power and function
- base for coherent decisions

Without it, Logical Enterprise loses structure.

## Next recommended reading

Now that functions are organized by logical dependency, the next step is to understand **how decisions fit into this structure**.
