# Adaptation by Company Type

Logical Enterprise does not depend on company size, number of people, or maturity level.

What changes is not the model. What changes is **the level of detail** and **the moment it is applied**.

This document shows how Logical Enterprise adapts to different types of companies without losing its essence.

---

## Companies in idea or early phase

The company does not formally exist yet, or is taking its first steps.

Decisions start early, even if people do not notice:

- what will be created
- for whom
- with which constraints
- with which priorities

### How Logical Enterprise applies to companies in idea or early phase

- helps think as a company from the start
- makes clear functions that do not yet exist
- avoids contradictory decisions at the origin
- creates a base for future growth

Here, Logical Enterprise works as a **thinking structure**.

---

## Solo founders

A single person performs multiple functions. Decides everything. Executes everything.

The risk is not lack of capacity, but overload and loss of clarity.

### How Logical Enterprise applies to solo founders

- separates functions, even with a single person
- helps shift from executor to thinker
- avoids impulsive decisions
- creates memory of choices made

Logical Enterprise becomes constant support for better decisions.

---

## Small teams

The team starts to grow. Functions are distributed. Decisions multiply.

The risk becomes:

- responsibility confusion
- conflicting decisions
- excessive dependence on a few people

### How Logical Enterprise applies to small teams

- makes clear who decides what (by function)
- records rules and constraints
- reduces unnecessary conflicts
- enables fast alignment

Here, it prevents growth from turning into chaos.

---

## Growing or established companies

The company already has:

- products
- processes
- people
- decision history

But much of it is implicit or concentrated in a few people.

### How Logical Enterprise applies to growing or established companies

- organizes decisions already made
- makes implicit rules visible
- preserves knowledge over time
- reduces dependence on specific individuals

Logical Enterprise helps the company **understand itself better**.

---

## Large or distributed companies

Complexity is high. Areas are specialized. Decisions impact many points.

The risk is:

- loss of the whole view
- local decisions breaking the whole
- difficulty aligning between areas

### How Logical Enterprise applies to large or distributed companies

- creates a common base of understanding
- organizes decisions by logical dependency
- makes clear constraints that cannot be crossed
- helps people and AI think about the whole

Here, it **connects areas structurally**.

---

## Use with or without Artificial Intelligence

In any type of company, the model works with or without AI.

Without AI:

- people think better
- decisions become clear
- conflicts decrease

With AI:

- answers become more consistent
- context is not lost
- AI acts as real support

Logical Enterprise prepares the ground. AI only expands the reach.

---

## What does not change in any scenario

Regardless of company type:

- functions are more important than job titles
- decisions must be recorded
- rules and constraints must be clear
- hierarchy is logical, not about power
- documentation must be used

These points sustain the model.

---

## In essence

Logical Enterprise does not change when company type or size changes.

It adapts because it was designed for that.

The model is the same. The context varies.

Now that the usage layer is complete, the next step is to enter the **models layer**, where Logical Enterprise gains **reusable structures**.
