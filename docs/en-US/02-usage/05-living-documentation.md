# Living and Sustainable Documentation

Logical Enterprise only works if documentation keeps up with reality.

Documentation that does not evolve becomes noise. Documentation that is not used becomes weight.

This document exists to explain how to keep Logical Enterprise documentation **alive, useful, and sustainable over time**.

---

## Documentation is not an end

In Logical Enterprise, documentation is not a goal in itself.

It exists to:

- preserve context
- support decisions
- reduce rework
- facilitate understanding
- maintain coherence over time

If documentation does not fulfill these roles, it has lost its function.

---

## What makes documentation "alive"

Documentation is alive when:

- it is consulted before decisions
- it is updated when something changes
- it reflects the current state of the company
- it is trusted by people and AI

It does not need to be perfect. It needs to be **relevant**.

---

## Document what matters (and only that)

A common mistake is documenting too much.

In Logical Enterprise, you should document mainly:

- relevant decisions
- rules that guide decisions
- constraints that cannot be broken
- changes that affect the whole

Excessive operational details tend to age quickly and are rarely reused.

---

## Updating as part of the process

Documentation should not be separate from work.

Whenever something relevant changes:

- a decision is made
- a rule is created or changed
- a constraint is adjusted
- an exception is applied

Documentation should be updated as part of the decision process itself.

---

## Small frequent updates

It is better:

- to update a little and often
than
- to update everything from time to time

Small updates:

- reduce resistance
- keep documentation trustworthy
- avoid large, traumatic revisions

---

## Clarity before formality

In Logical Enterprise, clarity is more important than format.

Prefer:

- simple texts
- direct language
- structures that are easy to navigate

If something is hard to explain, it is probably not clear enough.

---

## A single logical source of truth

Avoid multiple places with different versions of the same information.

Whenever possible:

- keep a single reference source
- avoid unsynced copies
- direct people and AI to the same place

Trusting documentation depends on knowing where it is.

---

## Documentation and Artificial Intelligence

For AI, living documentation is essential.

It enables AI to:

- use real decisions as context
- respect current rules and constraints
- avoid repeating discarded suggestions
- maintain coherence over time

AI without living documentation goes back to operating by assumption.

---

## When to review documentation

Some good moments for review:

- after important decisions
- when starting a new project
- when involving new people
- when recurring conflicts arise
- when AI starts generating odd answers

Reviewing does not mean rewriting everything. It means **adjusting what changed**.

---

## The risk of ignoring documentation

When documentation is ignored:

- decisions contradict each other
- rules stop being respected
- exceptions become the norm
- context is lost again

At that point, the problem is not lack of method. It is lack of minimal discipline.

---

## In essence

Living documentation is:

- used before deciding
- updated when something changes
- simple enough to maintain
- trusted by people and AI

Without it, Logical Enterprise loses its base.
