# Use Cases and Practical Examples

Logical Enterprise is not a theoretical concept. It appears in daily work, when decisions must be made and context cannot be lost.

This document shows common situations where Logical Enterprise helps in a clear and practical way.

The examples are generic, but reflect real problems.
For detailed application, consult the corresponding playbooks.

## Case 1 -- Creating a new product from scratch

### Situation - Case 1

A person or company has an idea and wants to turn it into a product.

The problem is not the idea, but the difficulty of:

- organizing decisions
- defining what the product is and is not
- avoiding contradictions from the start

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 1

- makes the required functions clear
- records important initial decisions
- defines product rules and constraints
- creates coherence before execution

For detailed application, see:
[Product Creation Playbook](../04-playbook/01-product-creation-playbook.md)

Even without a team, the thinking is already company level.

## Case 2 -- Company in fast growth

### Situation - Case 2

The company grows fast. New people join. Decisions multiply.

Knowledge starts to be lost and conflicts appear.

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 2

- organizes decisions already made
- makes implicit rules visible
- reduces dependence on specific people
- makes it easier for newcomers to understand

Growth stops being confusing and becomes more controlled.

## Case 3 -- Recurring use of Artificial Intelligence

### Situation - Case 3

The company uses AI to:

- generate ideas
- review decisions
- suggest solutions
- support planning

But answers vary, contradict each other, or do not respect the business.

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 3

- provides clear context for AI
- reduces generic answers
- maintains coherence over time
- turns AI into real support

For detailed application, see:
[AI Use Playbook](../04-playbook/04-ai-use-playbook.md)

## Case 4 -- Conflicts between areas

### Situation - Case 4

Areas disagree frequently. Each sees the problem in a different way.

Discussions become personal and decisions do not move forward.

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 4

- makes the functions of each area clear
- makes rules and constraints explicit
- creates a common reference for discussion
- shifts focus from people to decisions

For detailed application, see:
[Conflict Resolution Playbook](../04-playbook/03-conflict-resolution-playbook.md)

Conflict stops being emotional and becomes structural.

---

## Case 5 -- Reviewing an existing product or service

### Situation - Case 5

A product already exists, but needs to change.

There is fear of:

- breaking something
- creating unexpected impact
- repeating past mistakes

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 5

- retrieves prior decisions
- makes existing rules and constraints clear
- evaluates impacts before changing
- records new decisions

For detailed application, see:
[Product Evolution Playbook](../04-playbook/02-product-evolution-playbook.md)

Change stops being risky and becomes conscious.

---

## Case 6 -- Onboarding new people or partners

### Situation - Case 6

New people join the company, or external partners need to understand the business.

Alignment is slow and depends on repeated explanations.

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 6

- shows how the company works
- reduces reliance on verbal explanations
- speeds up understanding
- creates a common reference base

For detailed application, see:
[Training and Onboarding Playbook](../04-playbook/05-training-and-onboarding-playbook.md)

Less repetition. More autonomy.

## Case 7 -- Important strategic decisions

### Situation - Case 7

The company needs to make decisions with large impact:

- change direction
- shut down something
- invest in a new path

The risk is high.

### How Logical Enterprise helps - Case 7

- organizes decision context
- makes rules and constraints clear
- shows impacts on the whole
- avoids impulsive decisions

Decisions remain difficult, but are better grounded.

## What all cases have in common

In all these scenarios, the problem is not lack of capability.

It is lack of:

- clarity
- continuity
- shared context

Logical Enterprise acts exactly on these points.

---

## In essence

Logical Enterprise is useful when:

- decisions matter
- context cannot be lost
- impact goes beyond one area
- people and AI need to think together

It does not solve everything. But it solves what sustains the rest.
