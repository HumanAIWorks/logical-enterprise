# Decisions, Rules, and Constraints

Decisions, rules, and constraints are what keep Logical Enterprise coherent over time.

Without them being explicit:

- context is lost
- decisions contradict each other
- exceptions become the norm
- AI starts to assume

This document explains how to treat these three elements in a clear, simple, and reusable way.

---

## The role of each element

Although related, decisions, rules, and constraints are not the same thing.

- **Decision**: a choice made at a specific moment
- **Rule**: a criterion that guides multiple decisions
- **Constraint**: something that cannot be crossed

Confusing these concepts creates confusing documentation and fragile decisions.

---

## What a decision is

A decision exists when:

- there was more than one possible path
- a choice was made
- that choice impacts the future

Important decisions:

- define priorities
- create or remove options
- affect more than one function
- change products or services

Relevant decisions need to be recorded.

---

## What a rule is

Rules exist to:

- guide recurring decisions
- reduce ambiguity
- avoid conflicts

A rule answers questions like:

- "under what conditions can something be done?"
- "what should be considered?"
- "which criterion should be used to decide?"

Rules do not make decisions. They **guide** decisions.

---

## What a constraint is

Constraints define what **cannot** happen.

They exist to:

- protect the business
- preserve coherence
- avoid decisions that break the whole

Examples of constraints:

- something that cannot be changed
- something that cannot be offered
- something that requires a formal exception

Constraints are few, but they need to be very clear.

---

## How these elements relate

The correct relationship is:

- decisions **respect** rules and constraints
- rules **guide** decisions
- constraints **block** incompatible decisions

When this relationship is not clear, chaos appears.

---

## Recording decisions simply

A decision can be recorded by answering a few questions:

- what was the decision?
- why was it made?
- which alternatives were considered?
- which rules and constraints apply?
- which impacts are expected?

It is not a report. It is a record of context.

---

## Handling exceptions

Exceptions will always exist.

The problem is not the exception. It is the **unrecorded** exception.

When an exception occurs:

- make clear that it is an exception
- record the reason
- define whether it is temporary or permanent
- evaluate whether a rule needs to be adjusted

Explicit exceptions preserve coherence.

---

## Avoiding contradictory decisions

Before making a new decision, check:

- is there any related prior decision?
- does any rule apply?
- could any constraint be broken?

If the answer is yes, the conflict needs to be addressed before execution.

---

## Relationship with Artificial Intelligence

For AI, decisions, rules, and constraints work like tracks.

They prevent AI from:

- suggesting something already discarded
- breaking business rules
- ignoring important constraints

With that, AI starts to support decisions more consistently.

---

## In essence

In Logical Enterprise:

- decisions are recorded choices
- rules guide choices
- constraints protect the whole

Clarity in these three points is what keeps the model alive.

## Next recommended reading

Now that decisions, rules, and constraints are clear, the next step is to understand **how to document all of this sustainably**.
