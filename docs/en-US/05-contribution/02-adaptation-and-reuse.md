# Adaptation and Reuse of Logical Enterprise

This document explains how to **adapt and reuse Logical Enterprise** in different contexts without losing coherence, clarity, or purpose.

Logical Enterprise was created to be flexible, but not ambiguous.

## What it means to adapt Logical Enterprise

Adapting Logical Enterprise is not creating a new version of the concept.

Adapting means:

- adjusting the level of detail;
- choosing which parts make sense in the current context;
- applying models and playbooks proportionally;
- respecting the maturity and culture of the company.

The logic remains. The context changes.

---

## What it means to reuse Logical Enterprise

Reusing means applying the same reasoning in:

- other products;
- other projects;
- other companies;
- parallel initiatives;
- educational or personal contexts.

Reuse is valid when:

- the problem involves decisions;
- context needs to be preserved;
- impact goes beyond one person.

---

## What can vary in adaptation

When adapting or reusing, it is expected that the following vary:

- the amount of documentation;
- which models are used;
- which playbooks make sense;
- the degree of formality;
- the depth of the analysis.

These variations are healthy and expected.

---

## What should not vary

Some principles should not be broken:

- functions are more important than job titles;
- relevant decisions must be recorded;
- rules and constraints must be clear;
- hierarchy is logical, not about power;
- documentation must be used for real.

If these points are removed, the concept is lost.

---

## Adaptation in small companies

In small or individual companies:

- one person can perform multiple functions;
- documentation can be lighter;
- decisions can be recorded simply;
- models can be used only when needed.

What matters is clarity, not formality.

---

## Adaptation in larger companies

In larger or distributed companies:

- functions tend to be more specialized;
- decisions impact more areas;
- rules and constraints gain more importance;
- governance needs to be clearer.

Here, Logical Enterprise helps maintain a view of the whole.

---

## Reuse in parallel projects

When reusing Logical Enterprise in different projects:

- avoid mixing decisions from distinct contexts;
- keep documentation separate;
- make clear which logic applies to which project;
- share only principles, not specific rules.

Each project has its own Logical Enterprise.

---

## Commercial and internal use

Logical Enterprise can be:

- used internally by companies;
- adapted as an internal methodology;
- integrated into products and services;
- used as a base for consulting or training.

Commercial use is allowed, as long as the license is respected.

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

When adapting or reusing with AI:

- preserve the logical structure;
- avoid removing essential context;
- keep decisions, rules, and constraints accessible;
- adjust the level of detail according to AI use.

AI works best with consistent structure.

---

## Common adaptation mistakes

Avoid:

- simplifying to the point of losing logic;
- copying rules from one context to another;
- creating incompatible versions of the concept;
- using the name without applying the principles.

Adaptation without coherence becomes noise.

---

## In essence

Adapting and reusing Logical Enterprise means:

- respecting core principles;
- adjusting to the context reality;
- avoiding unnecessary rigidity;
- maintaining clarity and continuity.

The value is in the logic, not the form.
