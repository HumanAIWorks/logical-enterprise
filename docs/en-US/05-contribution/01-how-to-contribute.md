# How to Contribute to Logical Enterprise

This document explains **how to contribute in a practical way** to Logical Enterprise, keeping coherence with the concept and avoiding fragmentation over time.

Contributing is not only sending changes. It is **preserving the logic as it evolves**.

---

## Before contributing

Before proposing any change, check that:

- you understand the core concept of Logical Enterprise;
- you read the Concept, Usage, Models, and Playbooks sections;
- you can explain *why* the change is needed, not only *how*;
- the contribution solves a real problem.

If the answer is "no" for any of these points, it is worth reviewing before proceeding.

## Accepted contribution types

Contributions can take many forms.

### Content and clarity

- improving existing texts;
- simplifying language;
- correcting ambiguities;
- clearer and more applicable examples;
- translation adjustments.

### Structure and organization

- improving documentation navigation;
- adjusting the logical reading order;
- creating links between related documents;
- improving consistency between sections.

### Models and playbooks

- new playbooks for real recurring situations;
- adjustments to existing models when practical conflicts appear;
- application examples based on real use.

New models should only be proposed when **existing models are not sufficient**.

---

## What to avoid when contributing

Avoid contributions that:

- add complexity without clear gain;
- create incompatible variations of the concept;
- turn models into rigid processes;
- introduce unnecessary jargon;
- try to "close" the concept into a single methodology.

Logical Enterprise does not seek to standardize companies. It seeks to **organize reasoning**.

---

## How to propose a contribution

When proposing a contribution, make clear:

- which problem is being solved;
- where the problem appears today;
- how the proposal improves clarity or use;
- whether the change affects existing concepts.

Changes without context tend to be rejected.

---

## Small contributions are welcome

It is not necessary to propose something big.

Small contributions often have great impact, such as:

- improving a confusing paragraph;
- adjusting an example;
- fixing an inconsistency;
- improving reading flow.

The sum of these improvements keeps the project healthy.

---

## Discussion before implementation

For larger changes, it is recommended to:

- open a discussion before implementing;
- explain the motivation;
- listen to other points of view;
- adjust the proposal if needed.

This avoids rework and misalignment.

---

## Contribution and authorship

Logical Enterprise does not belong to a single person.

Contributions are not about individual authorship, but about **collective quality**.

The goal is to strengthen the concept, not the signature.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

When contributing, consider that:

- the documentation will be used by humans and AI;
- clarity and consistency are essential;
- implicit decisions generate inconsistent answers;
- structure helps reduce mistaken interpretations.

Contributing with quality also improves AI use.

---

## In essence

Contributing to Logical Enterprise means:

- respecting the core principles;
- improving clarity and applicability;
- avoiding unnecessary complexity;
- recording real learnings.

Logical Enterprise evolves with conscious use.
