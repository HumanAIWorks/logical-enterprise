# Logical Enterprise License and Legal Use

This document explains how Logical Enterprise can be used legally, clearly and accessibly, without requiring advanced legal knowledge.

It exists to avoid common doubts, mistaken interpretations, and unnecessary fear about use, adaptation, and commercial application.

## What is the Logical Enterprise license

Logical Enterprise is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPLv3)**.

The full license text is available in the `LICENSE` file at the root of the repository.

---

## What this license allows

The license allows you to:

- use Logical Enterprise in any type of company or project;
- adapt the texts, models, and playbooks to your reality;
- modify the structure for internal use;
- use it commercially, including in consulting, training, or products;
- integrate Logical Enterprise into software, methodologies, or services.

You do not need to ask for permission for any of these uses.

---

## Internal use in companies

If Logical Enterprise is used only internally:

- there is no obligation to publish adaptations;
- documentation can remain private;
- models can be freely adjusted.

This use is fully allowed.

---

## Use as a service or product

If Logical Enterprise is used as the basis for a service accessible to third parties, such as:

- an online platform;
- a system offered via web;
- a consulting service structured as a public product;

the license requires that:

- parts derived from Logical Enterprise remain under AGPLv3;
- adaptations made are made available to service users.

This ensures transparency and reciprocity.

---

## What the license does not require

The license **does not require** that you:

- make the business public as a whole;
- disclose commercial strategies;
- expose internal or customer data;
- publish code or content unrelated to Logical Enterprise.

The obligation applies only to what is directly derived from it.

---

## Why AGPLv3 was chosen

AGPLv3 was chosen because it:

- allows broad and commercial use;
- prevents silent appropriation of the concept;
- requires transparency when used as a service;
- protects Logical Enterprise as a common good.

It balances freedom with responsibility.

## This document does not replace legal advice

This text is only explanatory.

It does not replace:

- reading the full license;
- professional legal guidance.

If in doubt about a specific case, consult a specialist.

---

## In essence

The Logical Enterprise license exists to:

- allow free use and adaptation;
- enable commercial use;
- require transparency when used as a service;
- protect Logical Enterprise as a common good.
