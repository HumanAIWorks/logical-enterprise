# Contribution, Adaptation, and Reuse Introduction

Logical Enterprise was designed to be **shareable, adaptable, and reusable**.

This document explains how to contribute to the concept, how to adapt it to different realities, and how to reuse it without losing coherence.

---

## The spirit of Logical Enterprise

Logical Enterprise is not a closed product.

It is:

- an open model of thinking;
- an organized way to structure decisions;
- a set of ideas that evolve with use.

Therefore, contribution and adaptation are part of the concept itself.

---

## Contributing does not mean complicating

Contributing to Logical Enterprise is not:

- adding unnecessary layers;
- creating incompatible variations;
- making the model more complex.

Contributing means:

- improving clarity;
- recording real learnings;
- correcting ambiguities;
- proposing coherent extensions.

If a contribution makes understanding harder, it is not a good contribution.

## Types of possible contributions

It is possible to contribute in many ways, for example:

- improving texts and explanations;
- clearer examples;
- new models, when truly necessary;
- new playbooks for recurring situations;
- language adjustments for other cultural contexts;
- fixes for inconsistencies.

Not every contribution needs to be technical.

## Adaptation to company context

Each company has its own reality.

Adapting Logical Enterprise means:

- adjusting the level of detail;
- choosing which models to use;
- defining which playbooks make sense;
- respecting culture, maturity, and timing.

Adapting does not break the concept. It applies it consciously.

## What should not be changed

Some principles should not be broken:

- functions are more important than job titles;
- decisions must be recorded;
- rules and constraints must be clear;
- hierarchy is logical, not about power;
- documentation must be alive and used.

These points sustain the model.

## Reuse in other projects or companies

Logical Enterprise can be reused:

- in other products;
- in other companies;
- in parallel projects;
- in educational contexts;
- in personal or professional use.

Each reuse should:

- respect the basic principles;
- make the application context clear;
- avoid mixing incompatible logics.

---

## Commercial use and adaptation

Logical Enterprise can be used commercially.

It can be:

- adapted for specific needs;
- integrated into products and services;
- used as a base for internal methodologies.

Commercial use does not require prior authorization, as long as the license and its terms are respected.
For details, see: [License and Legal Use](03-license-and-legal-use.md).

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

When reusing Logical Enterprise with AI:

- keep the structure clear;
- avoid removing essential context;
- preserve decisions, rules, and constraints;
- adapt models without losing coherence.

AI depends on structure to generate real value.

---

## In essence

Contributing, adapting, and reusing are part of Logical Enterprise.

The model grows when:

- it is used for real;
- it is questioned responsibly;
- it is adapted consciously;
- it is shared with clarity.
