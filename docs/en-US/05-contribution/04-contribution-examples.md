# Contribution Examples

This document presents practical examples of valid contributions to Logical Enterprise.

The goal is to reduce ambiguity and make clear, in practice, what it means to contribute in a healthy and coherent way.

---

## Why examples matter

Even with clear principles, contributions can raise doubts like:

- does this improve understanding or just add opinion;
- does this adapt the concept or distort it;
- does this solve a real problem or create complexity.

Examples help answer those questions.

---

## Example 1 -- Clarity improvement in a text

### Situation - Example 1

A section is conceptually correct, but hard to understand.

### Valid contribution - Example 1

- simplify the language;
- remove unnecessary terms;
- improve flow;
- keep the original meaning.

### Why it is valid - Example 1

It improves comprehension without changing the concept.

---

## Example 2 -- Adding a practical example

### Situation - Example 2

A model or playbook explains the logic, but does not show real application.

### Valid contribution - Example 2

- add a generic example;
- based on real situations;
- without sensitive data or specific names;
- connecting theory to practice.

### Why it is valid - Example 2

It makes adoption easier and reduces excessive abstraction.

---

## Example 3 -- Navigation or reading order adjustment

### Situation - Example 3

A document assumes knowledge that appears only later.

### Valid contribution - Example 3

- suggest a change in reading order;
- add links between files;
- improve logical flow.

### Why it is valid - Example 3

It improves experience without changing conceptual content.

---

## Example 4 -- New playbook for recurring problem

### Situation - Example 4

The same type of problem appears in real contexts and is not covered.

### Valid contribution - Example 4

- create a new playbook;
- focused on a specific problem;
- aligned with the existing narrative level;
- without creating unnecessary new rules.

### Why it is valid - Example 4

It expands applicability without breaking the logic.

---

## Example 5 -- Invalid contribution

### Situation - Example 5

Someone tries to turn Logical Enterprise into a rigid process.

### Invalid contribution - Example 5

- create mandatory checklists;
- impose specific tools;
- define job titles as central;
- close the concept into an exclusive methodology.

### Why it is not valid - Example 5

It reduces flexibility and distorts the original purpose.

## AI use in contributions

AI can be used to:

- review text clarity;
- identify inconsistencies;
- suggest language improvements;
- simulate reading by new users.

The final decision is always human.

## In essence

Good contributions:

- increase clarity;
- preserve coherence;
- solve real problems;
- avoid artificial complexity.

Contributing well is caring for the concept.
