# Frequently Asked Questions about Logical Enterprise

This FAQ gathers the most common doubts from people who come into contact with the Logical Enterprise concept for the first time.

It does not replace reading the documentation, but helps clarify recurring points, avoid mistaken interpretations, and reinforce important boundaries of the concept.

---

## What is Logical Enterprise, in a few words?

Logical Enterprise is a structured way to make explicit how a company works.

It organizes functions, decisions, rules, constraints, and principles in a logical and documented way, allowing people and Artificial Intelligence to understand the company context consistently.

See: [00 - Definition of Logical Enterprise](../01-concept/00-definition.md).

---

## Is Logical Enterprise a methodology?

No.

It is not a closed method, it does not define mandatory steps, and it does not impose tools.

Logical Enterprise is a model of thinking and logical organization that can be adapted to each company's reality.

See: [01 - Logical Enterprise Boundaries](../01-concept/01-boundaries.md) and [02 - What Logical Enterprise Is Not](../01-concept/02-what-it-is-not.md).

---

## Is Logical Enterprise a management framework?

Not in the traditional sense.

It does not replace management, agile, or product frameworks.

It acts at a prior level, organizing company reasoning so any framework can be used with more clarity and coherence.

See: [02 - What Logical Enterprise Is Not](../01-concept/02-what-it-is-not.md).

---

## Does this only work for large companies?

No.

Logical Enterprise does not depend on company size, but on the level of clarity required.

It can be used by:

- people starting a business from scratch;
- small teams;
- mid-sized companies;
- large and complex organizations.

What changes is the level of detail, not the concept.

See: [07 - Adaptation by Company Type](../02-usage/07-adaptation-by-company-type.md) and [00 - Logical Enterprise Manifesto](../00-introduction/00-manifesto.md).

---

## Do I need to document everything from the beginning?

No.

Logical Enterprise can start at any point.

A company can:

- document only what is most critical;
- expand as new needs emerge;
- or decide to document everything more broadly from the start.

This is a strategic choice, not a requirement of the model.

See: [01 - How to Start](../02-usage/01-how-to-start.md) and [05 - Living and Sustainable Documentation](../02-usage/05-living-documentation.md).

---

## Does Logical Enterprise make the company slower?

No.

It avoids rework, conflicts, and contradictory decisions.

The time invested in clarity reduces time lost with corrections, misalignment, and constant re-explanations.

See: [00 - When to Use Logical Enterprise](../02-usage/00-when-to-use.md) and [04 - Logical Enterprise Principles](../01-concept/04-principles.md).

---

## Does this become bureaucracy?

Not if used correctly.

Logical Enterprise does not exist to create unnecessary documents, but to record what already exists implicitly.

When it becomes bureaucracy, it is usually because it is being used as control, not as clarity.

See: [05 - Living and Sustainable Documentation](../02-usage/05-living-documentation.md) and [04 - Logical Enterprise Principles](../01-concept/04-principles.md).

---

## Does Logical Enterprise replace leaders or decision makers?

No.

It does not make decisions.

It organizes context so human decisions are better, more conscious, and more consistent.
It expands the capacity of decision makers, empowers human work, and reinforces that AI should support, not replace.
Logical Enterprise defends and spreads human work amplified by correct AI use.

See: [04 - Logical Enterprise Principles](../01-concept/04-principles.md) and [00 - Definition of Logical Enterprise](../01-concept/00-definition.md).

---

## Does Logical Enterprise replace developers or other areas?

No.

It does not replace professionals or automate human judgment.

It makes decisions, rules, and constraints clearer so each area works with more context and less noise.
This expands the capacity of people and AI as support, not replacement.

See: [02 - What Logical Enterprise Is Not](../01-concept/02-what-it-is-not.md) and [04 - Logical Enterprise Principles](../01-concept/04-principles.md).

---

## What is the role of Artificial Intelligence in all of this?

AI acts as support.

With Logical Enterprise, AI starts to:

- understand the company context;
- respect rules and constraints;
- suggest coherent solutions;
- help analyze impacts and alternatives.

Without Logical Enterprise, AI acts generically and disconnected.

See: [03 - Why LLMs Need Logical Enterprise](../01-concept/03-why-llms-need-this.md) and [04 - AI Use Playbook](../04-playbook/04-ai-use-playbook.md).

---

## Does AI start running the company?

No.

Logical Enterprise does not turn AI into a decision maker.

It ensures AI has direction, context, and clear constraints to support people, not replace them.

See: [04 - Logical Enterprise Principles](../01-concept/04-principles.md) and [04 - AI Use Playbook](../04-playbook/04-ai-use-playbook.md).

---

## Does it work without AI?

Yes.

Logical Enterprise already brings value for people by organizing understanding, communication, and continuity.

AI amplifies that value, but it is not required.

See: [01 - Origin of Logical Enterprise](../00-introduction/01-origin.md) and [00 - When to Use Logical Enterprise](../02-usage/00-when-to-use.md).

---

## Is Logical Enterprise software?

No.

It does not depend on any specific tool.

It can be implemented with simple documents, text files, management tools, or custom systems.

See: [02 - What Logical Enterprise Is Not](../01-concept/02-what-it-is-not.md).

---

## Can I adapt Logical Enterprise to my reality?

Yes.

Adaptation is part of the concept.

What should not be done is to distort principles or turn the model into something rigid and prescriptive.

See: [02 - Adaptation and Reuse](../05-contribution/02-adaptation-and-reuse.md).

---

## Can I use this commercially?

Yes.

Logical Enterprise can be used in consulting, training, products, and services.

It is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPLv3).

See: [03 - License and Legal Use](../05-contribution/03-license-and-legal-use.md).

---

## Do I need to open everything I do if I use it commercially?

No.

The transparency obligation applies only to parts directly derived from Logical Enterprise when used as a public service.

Business, strategy, and internal data do not need to be exposed.

See: [03 - License and Legal Use](../05-contribution/03-license-and-legal-use.md).

---

## Does Logical Enterprise guarantee success?

No.

It does not eliminate errors, risks, or uncertainties.

It increases clarity, reduces confusion, and improves decision quality, but it does not replace responsibility, human judgment, or execution.

See: [03 - What Logical Enterprise Solves](../00-introduction/03-what-logical-enterprise-solves.md) and [02 - What Logical Enterprise Is Not](../01-concept/02-what-it-is-not.md).

---

## Where should I start if I want to apply it?

The best starting point is to identify:

- where confusion is recurring;
- where decisions get lost;
- where conflicts arise due to lack of clarity.

From there, start small or broad, depending on what makes sense for your reality.

See: [00 - When to Use Logical Enterprise](../02-usage/00-when-to-use.md) and [01 - How to Start](../02-usage/01-how-to-start.md).

---

## Where can I contribute or learn more?

The documentation is open for reading, use, and contribution.

Consult the **Contribution** section to understand how to collaborate in alignment with the concept.

See: [00 - Contribution Introduction](../05-contribution/00-introduction.md) and [01 - How to Contribute](../05-contribution/01-how-to-contribute.md).

---

## In essence

Logical Enterprise exists to answer a simple question:

How can a company understand itself in a clear, consistent, and shareable way?

Everything documented here serves that purpose.
