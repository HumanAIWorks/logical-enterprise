# Logical Enterprise Boundaries

For Logical Enterprise to be useful, it is essential to understand **where it starts and where it ends**.

This document exists to avoid two common problems:

- trying to use Logical Enterprise to solve everything
- rejecting Logical Enterprise because of expecting something it does not propose to do

Defining boundaries does not limit the concept. On the contrary: **it makes correct use possible**.

---

## Where Logical Enterprise starts

Logical Enterprise starts when the company decides to **make explicit how it works**.

It starts when the company begins to record, clearly and accessibly:

- which functions exist and why
- which decisions have already been made
- which rules guide those decisions
- which constraints cannot be crossed
- how products and services are conceived and evolve

From this point on, the company stops depending only on memory, past conversations, and individual interpretations.

---

## Where Logical Enterprise acts

Logical Enterprise acts **at the level of understanding**.

It acts:

- before execution
- during decision making
- when there are doubts or conflicts
- when something new needs to be created
- when something existing needs to be changed

Here, "during" means at the moment of deciding and planning -- not implementation.

It does not do the work. It **guides how the work should be thought about**.

---

## Where Logical Enterprise ends

Logical Enterprise ends exactly where execution begins.

It **does not replace**:

- technical implementation
- operational work
- day to day management
- human leadership
- responsibility for decisions

After understanding is clear, work moves to the people, teams, and systems responsible.

---

## What is outside the scope of Logical Enterprise

To avoid mistaken interpretations, it is important to make clear what **is not part** of Logical Enterprise.

It is not responsible for:

- executing tasks
- managing people
- defining operational goals
- choosing tools
- writing code
- automating processes

These activities can benefit from Logical Enterprise, but they are not part of it.

---

## Logical Enterprise does not compete with existing methods

Logical Enterprise was not created to replace:

- management methods
- agile frameworks
- governance models
- established internal processes

It acts **before** and **around** those methods, providing clarity so they work better.

If a method already exists, Logical Enterprise helps answer:

- why it is used
- where it applies
- which constraints it must respect
- how it connects to the whole

---

## Relationship with tools and technology

Tools are means. Logical Enterprise is understanding.

It does not depend on:

- specific software
- a platform
- a language
- a tech stack

It can be documented in plain text as long as the content is clear, consistent, and accessible.

Tools only come **after**, as support for execution.

---

## Relationship with Artificial Intelligence

**Logical Enterprise does not make AI take decisions.**

It provides AI with:

- context
- constraints
- history
- a view of the business

The final decision remains human.

AI acts as support, not as authority.

---

## Why respecting these boundaries is essential

When boundaries are not clear:

- expectations get distorted
- frustrations appear
- the concept is misused
- Logical Enterprise seems to "not work"

In most cases, the problem is not the model, but use outside scope.

---

## In summary

Logical Enterprise:

- starts with understanding
- acts through clarity
- ends before execution

It does not do the work. It makes the work **possible to do with coherence**.

## Next recommended reading

Now that the scope is clear, the next step is to understand **what Logical Enterprise is not**, to eliminate mistaken interpretations for good.
