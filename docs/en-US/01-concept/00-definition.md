# Definition of Logical Enterprise

After understanding the origin of the problem and what Logical Enterprise aims to solve, it is possible to define precisely **what it is**.

This definition exists to remove ambiguity, align expectations, and serve as a **stable reference** for both people and Artificial Intelligence.

---

## Direct definition

**Logical Enterprise** is a model that describes how a company works and makes decisions, making clear the functions (organizational roles) that exist in the company, its rules, flows, constraints, and decisions, so that this operation can be understood, used, and evolved over time.

It does not describe people or job titles. It describes **what must exist for the company to work well**.

---

## Expanded definition

Logical Enterprise is the layer where the following are recorded, clearly and accessibly:

- which functions exist in the company and why they exist
- which problems each function must solve
- how products and services are created and evolve
- which rules guide decisions
- which constraints cannot be crossed
- which decisions have already been made and why

This layer works as the **logical source of truth for the company**.

It does not execute work. It **guides the work**.

## What "logic" means in this context

In Logical Enterprise, the term "logic" has no relation to code, mathematics, or formal systems.

Here, "logic" means **coherence**.

A company is logical when:

- decisions do not contradict each other
- rules are known
- exceptions are clear
- impacts are considered before acting
- the whole is more important than isolated decisions

Logical Enterprise makes this coherence **visible, understandable, and verifiable**.

## Logical Enterprise is not an org chart

A common mistake is to confuse Logical Enterprise with hierarchical structure.

Logical Enterprise:

- does not define who reports to whom
- does not describe job titles or power levels
- does not replace the org chart

It answers a different question:

> "Which functions must exist for the company to work coherently?"

These functions can be performed by:

- one person
- several people
- a team
- or, in some cases, automated systems

---

## Functions before job titles

In Logical Enterprise, the focus is on the function, not the job title.

This means making clear:

- what the role of each function is
- why that function exists
- which decisions it can make
- which rules it must respect

This approach ensures that the model:

- works in small or large companies
- remains valid even when people change
- is understood by those who arrive later
- can be used by AI without depending on personal context

---

## Logical Enterprise as a basis for decisions

When Logical Enterprise is well defined, new decisions stop being made in the dark.

It becomes possible to evaluate, for example:

- does this decision respect existing rules?
- which company functions does it affect?
- does it conflict with prior decisions?
- does it require an exception to be recorded?
- does it change how the product or service works?

This does not eliminate hard decisions, but it avoids decisions **disconnected from the whole**.

---

## Relationship with Artificial Intelligence

For Artificial Intelligence, Logical Enterprise works as a map of the company.

It provides:

- clear business context
- well defined constraints
- decision history
- a view of how the company works

With that, AI stops working in the dark and starts supporting human decisions **more consistently and reliably**.

AI does not decide alone. It helps people think better.

---

## What Logical Enterprise is not

To avoid mistaken interpretations:

It is not software and it does not replace people; it is a **model for understanding the company**.

## Why this definition is important

Without a clear definition, each person understands Logical Enterprise in a different way.

That creates confusion and weakens the concept itself.

This definition exists to:

- create a common point of understanding
- serve as a base for documentation
- guide the practical application of the model
- protect the concept against distortions
