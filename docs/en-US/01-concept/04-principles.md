# Logical Enterprise Principles

Logical Enterprise is not sustained only by definition. It stays functional over time through **clear principles**.

These principles are not rigid rules. They are practical guidelines to avoid confusion, loss of context, and disconnected decisions.

Principles guide; rules are specific guidelines of each company.

---

## Principle 1 -- Clarity before execution

Before doing, you must understand.

Every relevant decision should start from:

- a clearly defined problem
- a common understanding of the product or service
- known rules and constraints

Executing without clarity only speeds up errors.

---

## Principle 2 -- Functions before people

Logical Enterprise describes **functions**, not job titles or individuals.

This means:

- understanding the role that needs to exist
- defining why that role exists
- establishing which decisions it can make

People change. Functions remain.

---

## Principle 3 -- Decisions must be recorded

Important decisions cannot depend on memory.

Whenever a decision:

- defines a constraint
- creates an exception
- changes how a product works
- impacts more than one function

It must be recorded in a simple and accessible way.

Recording decisions avoids repeated discussions and loss of context.

---

## Principle 4 -- Explicit rules prevent conflicts

Conflicts arise when rules are implicit.

Logical Enterprise encourages:

- rules to exist
- rules to be known
- exceptions to be explicit

When rules are clear, debate stops being personal and becomes objective.

---

## Principle 5 -- The whole comes before the parts

Decisions made in one part of the company can generate unexpected impacts in others.

Before creating, changing, or deciding something in one part, it is necessary to evaluate:

- the impact on other functions
- the impact on the product
- the impact on the business as a whole

Logical Enterprise exists to make those impacts visible before the problem happens.

---

## Principle 6 -- Continuity over time

Logical Enterprise is not a snapshot. It is a living record.

This implies:

- preserving past decisions
- understanding why something was done
- avoiding reopening discussions without need

The past informs the present. The present does not need to reinvent everything.

---

## Principle 7 -- Simplicity is a choice

Documenting does not mean complicating.

Logical Enterprise values:

- simple texts
- direct language
- structures that are easy to maintain

If something is hard to explain, it is probably not clear enough.

---

## Principle 8 -- AI as support, not authority

Logical Enterprise does not delegate decisions to AI.

It provides context so AI can:

- help with thinking
- explore alternatives
- anticipate risks
- connect impacts

The final decision remains human.

---

## Principle 9 -- Documentation is a logical source of truth

When there is conflict between:

- memory
- interpretation
- opinion
- execution

Logical Enterprise documentation is the reference point.

This does not eliminate debate, but it avoids decisions based on assumptions.

---

## Principle 10 -- Evolve without breaking

Logical Enterprise accepts change, but in a conscious way.

Changes should:

- respect existing decisions
- record new choices
- make clear what changed and why

Evolving is not erasing the past. It is **building on top of it**.

---

## In summary

The principles of Logical Enterprise exist to:

- maintain coherence
- reduce noise
- preserve context
- facilitate decisions
- support people and AI

They do not lock things down. They **guide**.
