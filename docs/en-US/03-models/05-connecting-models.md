# Connecting the Models

Logical Enterprise models do not exist in isolation.

They work as parts of the same reasoning.

This document explains how the models connect, in which order they make sense, and how they should be used together.

---

## Models are not mandatory steps

Models:

- are not a fixed checklist
- do not need to be used always
- do not require a rigid order

They exist to support thinking, not to impose process.

---

## The base: Functions

When you choose to use models, everything starts with functions.

Without clear functions:

- there is no defined responsibility
- decisions float
- rules lose reference

The **Function Model** is the base of all others.

---

## Decisions live within functions

Every decision:

- is made by one or more functions
- must respect their constraints

The **Decision Model** records important choices and keeps context over time.

Without it, decisions repeat or contradict each other.

---

## Rules and constraints guide decisions

Rules and constraints:

- guide recurring decisions
- protect the whole
- reduce ambiguity

The **Rules and Constraints Model** works as a constant reference for new and old decisions.

---

## Impact analysis connects everything

Impact Analysis:

- uses functions already mapped
- checks rules and constraints
- considers existing decisions

It ensures local decisions do not break the whole.

---

## A simple logical flow

When models are used together, the reasoning usually follows this flow:

1. Functions -- who decides what
2. Decision -- what was chosen
3. Rules and Constraints -- what must be respected
4. Impact Analysis -- what changes in the whole

This flow is not mandatory, but it is logical.

---

## Not every case needs all models

Examples:

- a simple decision may use only functions and decision
- a major change may use all models
- a new rule may arise without deep analysis

Use should be proportional to impact.

---

## Models as a common language

When everyone uses the same models:

- conversations become more objective
- conflicts decrease
- decisions become clearer
- AI responds more consistently

Models become a common language of the company.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

For AI, the connection between models is essential.

It allows AI to:

- understand the full context
- respect existing constraints
- use real decisions as a base
- avoid isolated answers

Connected models reduce hallucination and contradiction.

---

## The mistake of treating models as files

A common mistake is to think of models only as documents.

In Logical Enterprise, they are:

- ways of thinking
- living references
- reasoning structures

The files only record that.

---

## In essence

Logical Enterprise models:

- complement each other
- do not overlap
- work together
- support people and AI

Separate, they help. Connected, they sustain the whole.
