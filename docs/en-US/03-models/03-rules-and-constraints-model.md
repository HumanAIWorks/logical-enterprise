# Rules and Constraints Model

The Rules and Constraints Model exists to make clear what can be done, what cannot be done, and under which conditions something can happen.

It avoids contradictory decisions and protects company coherence over time.

---

## The model's objective

This model serves to:

- guide recurring decisions
- avoid personal interpretations
- protect products and the business
- provide safety for people and AI

Without clear rules and constraints, each decision becomes a new debate.

---

## Difference between rule and constraint

Although related, rule and constraint are not the same.

- **Rule**: guides decisions
- **Constraint**: blocks decisions

Rules say *how to decide*. Constraints say *how far you can go*.

---

## When to use this model

Use the Rules and Constraints Model when:

- the same type of decision repeats
- frequent conflicts appear
- exceptions start to become the norm
- AI suggests paths outside the business
- local decisions affect the whole

If something must always be respected, it should become a rule or constraint.

---

## Simple structure of the model

Rules and constraints can be described directly.

### 1. Identification

A simple and clear name.

Examples:

- Initial Scope Rule
- Security Constraint
- Prioritization Rule

---

### 2. Description

Explain directly:

- what the rule guides
- or what the constraint prevents

Avoid long texts. Clarity is the most important thing.

---

### 3. When it applies

Make clear:

- in which situations the rule applies
- when the constraint must be respected

This avoids use outside context.

---

### 4. Related functions

Indicate:

- which functions must respect it
- which functions apply this rule or constraint

This avoids responsibility conflicts.

---

### 5. Exceptions (when they exist)

If exceptions are allowed:

- make clear when
- record it as an exception
- link it to a specific decision

Unrecorded exceptions break the model.

---

## Simple (generic) examples

**Rule:** Reduced Initial Scope

- Defines that the initial product must solve only the main problem.

**Constraint:** Data Security

- No decision can compromise sensitive customer data.

These examples already guide decisions without excessive detail.

---

## Relationship with decisions

Every decision:

- must respect existing rules
- cannot cross constraints

If a decision breaks a constraint, it must be revised or become an explicit exception.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

For AI, rules and constraints work like tracks.

They prevent AI from:

- suggesting unfeasible solutions
- ignoring important constraints
- optimizing parts while breaking the whole

With clear rules, AI collaborates better.

---

## Common mistakes when using the model

Avoid:

- creating too many rules
- writing vague rules
- not reviewing old rules
- allowing exceptions without records

A few clear rules work better than many confusing ones.

---

## In essence

The Rules and Constraints Model serves to:

- guide recurring decisions
- protect coherence
- reduce conflicts
- support people and AI

Rules guide. Constraints protect.

Now that functions, decisions, rules, and constraints are modeled, the next step is to understand **how to evaluate impacts before acting**.
