# Impact Analysis Model

The Impact Analysis Model exists to avoid decisions that look good locally but create problems in other parts of the company.

It helps to think **before acting**.

---

## The model's objective

This model serves to:

- anticipate side effects
- avoid breaking rules or constraints
- protect existing products
- reduce rework
- support more conscious decisions

It does not predict the future. It reduces surprises.

---

## When to use the Impact Analysis Model

Use this model when:

- a decision affects more than one function
- something existing will be changed
- a new product or service will be created
- rules or constraints can be impacted
- the risk of error is high

If the decision is simple and isolated, the model may not be necessary.

---

## Simple structure of the model

An impact analysis can be done by answering a few questions.

### 1. What is being proposed?

Describe clearly:

- what will be created, changed, or removed
- which decision is under analysis

Without clarity here, everything else becomes fragile.

---

### 2. Which functions are impacted?

List:

- which company functions are affected
- whether the impact is direct or indirect

This helps avoid isolated decisions.

---

### 3. Which rules and constraints apply?

Check:

- which rules guide this decision
- whether any constraint can be crossed

If a constraint will be broken, the decision must be revised or become an explicit exception.

---

### 4. Expected impacts

List known impacts:

- positive
- negative
- main risks

It is not a complete list. It is a conscious view.

---

### 5. What changes if nothing is done?

Evaluate:

- risks of not deciding
- consequences of keeping the current state

Sometimes not deciding is also a decision.

---

### 6. Does the decision still make sense?

After the analysis, confirm:

- does the decision remain valid?
- are adjustments needed?
- does any rule need to be revised?

If the answer changes, that is part of the process.

## A simple (generic) example

**Proposal:** add a new product feature

- **Functions impacted:** product definition, technical execution, support
- **Rules/Constraints:** respect initial scope, do not compromise security
- **Positive impacts:** increase perceived value
- **Negative impacts:** higher technical complexity
- **Risk of not acting:** losing competitiveness

That level of analysis already avoids impulsive decisions.

---

## Relationship with other models

The Impact Analysis Model:

- uses functions already mapped
- respects existing decisions
- checks rules and constraints

It connects all previous models.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

AI can help to:

- raise possible impacts
- point out forgotten risks
- suggest alternative scenarios

But the final analysis remains human.

AI supports. It does not decide.

---

## Common mistakes when using the model

Avoid:

- analyses that are too long
- trying to predict everything
- using the model for trivial decisions
- ignoring obvious impacts

The model should be light and used when it makes sense.

---

## In essence

The Impact Analysis Model serves to:

- think before acting
- reduce surprises
- protect the whole
- support conscious decisions

It does not block decisions. It avoids blind decisions.
