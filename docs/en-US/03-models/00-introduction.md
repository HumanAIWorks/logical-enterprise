# Introduction to Logical Enterprise Models

Up to this point, Logical Enterprise was presented as a way of thinking, organizing, and making decisions.

From this point on, we enter the **models** layer.

This document exists to explain the role of models within Logical Enterprise before presenting any concrete structure.

## What models are in Logical Enterprise

In Logical Enterprise, a model is a **reusable reasoning structure**.

It exists to:

- help think more clearly
- avoid forgetting important points
- maintain coherence between decisions
- reduce unnecessary variation

Models do not make decisions. They **guide thinking**.

---

## Why models are needed

Even with clear principles, it is easy to forget details when complexity increases.

Models help to:

- avoid skipping important steps
- keep focus on what matters
- ensure decisions follow the company logic
- facilitate use by other people and by AI

They work as **guides**, not fixed rules.

---

## Models do not replace thinking

A common mistake is to use models as if they were ready made answers.

In Logical Enterprise:

- models do not decide
- models do not replace judgment
- models do not eliminate responsibility

If a model becomes an automatic form, it has lost its purpose.

---

## Models are not mandatory

Logical Enterprise works even without models documented in a structured way.

Models exist for:

- those who need recurring support
- those who deal with complex decisions
- those who want consistency over time

They are optional, but very useful when used well.

---

## When to use a model

A model makes sense when:

- the same type of decision repeats
- similar errors happen
- important points are forgotten
- reasoning varies too much between people
- AI generates inconsistent answers

If the problem is recurring, a model can help.

---

## Types of models in Logical Enterprise

Models can cover, for example:

- product or service definition
- impact analysis
- decision recording
- function mapping
- risk evaluation
- AI use in decisions

These are possible examples, not a fixed list.
Each model has a clear objective. There is no generic model for everything.

---

## Models as support for Artificial Intelligence

For AI, models work as a context structure.

They help to:

- organize the provided information
- maintain consistency between answers
- reduce overly free interpretations
- align suggestions with the company logic

Models make AI use more predictable and reliable.

---

## Simplicity as a rule

A good model:

- is easy to understand
- is easy to use
- is easy to maintain

If a model became too complex, it should be simplified.

Excessive complexity is a sign of lost clarity.

---

## In essence

In Logical Enterprise, models exist to:

- support thinking
- maintain coherence
- reduce forgetting
- facilitate reuse

They do not lock things down. They **help you think better**.
