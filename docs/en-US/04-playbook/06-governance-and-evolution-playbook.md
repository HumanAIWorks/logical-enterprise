# Governance and Evolution of Logical Enterprise Playbook

This playbook shows how to **maintain, evolve, and protect Logical Enterprise over time**, without turning it into bureaucracy or something hard to sustain.

It exists to ensure Logical Enterprise remains **useful, reliable, and aligned with the company's reality**.

---

## When to use this playbook

Use this playbook when:

- Logical Enterprise is already in use;
- decisions start to accumulate;
- rules and constraints need to evolve;
- doubts arise about who can change what;
- the company grows or changes context.

If Logical Enterprise is still being created, this playbook can be consulted later.

---

## The problem this playbook solves

Without minimal governance, it is common that:

- documentation becomes outdated;
- decisions conflict over time;
- rules lose validity without review;
- nobody knows who can change what;
- Logical Enterprise loses credibility.

This playbook exists to avoid that.

---

## Overview of the reasoning

Governing Logical Enterprise is not about controlling people.

It is about ensuring that:

- decisions have clear owners;
- changes are conscious;
- rules and constraints continue to make sense;
- documentation stays alive.

The general reasoning is:

1. Define governance responsibilities.
2. Establish how changes are made.
3. Review decisions, rules, and constraints.
4. Record evolutions clearly.
5. Maintain coherence over time.

---

## Step 1 -- Define governance responsibilities

Make clear:

- who can create or change decisions;
- who can create or change rules and constraints;
- who reviews major impacts;
- how governance conflicts are resolved.

These responsibilities are functions, not job titles.

---

## Step 2 -- Establish how changes happen

Define simply:

- when a change requires formal record;
- when a decision replaces another;
- when a rule needs review;
- when an exception becomes a rule.

Change without criteria generates instability.

---

## Step 3 -- Review decisions, rules, and constraints

Reviews do not need to be constant, but they need to exist.

Some good moments for review:

- after relevant business changes;
- when conflicts repeat;
- when AI starts generating incoherent answers;
- when rules stop making sense.

Review is not undoing. It is adjusting to current reality.

---

## Step 4 -- Record evolution, not just state

Avoid erasing the past.

Whenever possible:

- mark decisions as replaced;
- record the reason for change;
- keep history accessible;
- make clear what is now valid.

This preserves context and learning.

---

## Step 5 -- Keep Logical Enterprise usable

Excessive governance pushes use away.

Seek:

- simple change rules;
- easy to update documentation;
- clarity instead of formalism;
- real day to day use.

If it became heavy, something went off track.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

Governance helps AI to:

- use only active decisions;
- respect updated rules;
- ignore obsolete content;
- maintain coherence over time.

AI without governance goes back to operating by assumption.

---

## What to avoid in governance

Avoid:

- centralizing everything in one person;
- creating complex rituals;
- requiring unnecessary approvals;
- reviewing without clear reason;
- leaving changes unrecorded.

Governance should protect, not block.

---

## In essence

This playbook serves to:

- keep Logical Enterprise reliable;
- allow evolution without chaos;
- preserve historical context;
- support sustainable growth.

Logical Enterprise evolves with the company.
