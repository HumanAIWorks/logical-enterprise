# Product Creation Playbook

This playbook shows how to apply Logical Enterprise in product creation, from the emergence of the idea to the first decisions that precede execution.

It does not define a rigid process. It helps to **think with order**, reduce common errors, and maintain coherence from the start.

---

## When to use this playbook

Use this playbook when:

- a new product idea emerges;
- an existing product needs to be redefined;
- initial decisions are confused;
- AI is being used to help creation;
- the risk of rework is high.

If the product is already mature and stable, other playbooks may be more appropriate.

---

## The problem this playbook solves

In product creation, it is common to:

- skip important steps;
- confuse idea with product;
- mix decision with execution;
- change direction multiple times without noticing;
- use AI in a generic and inconsistent way.

This playbook exists to avoid these points.

## Overview of the reasoning

Product creation, from a Logical Enterprise perspective, follows a simple reasoning:

1. Understand the problem.
2. Define what the product is and what it is not.
3. Make explicit the functions involved.
4. Record important decisions.
5. Define initial rules and constraints.
6. Evaluate impacts before moving forward.

These steps are not a fixed sequence, but a **logical order**.
They serve as a reference and can be revisited depending on context.

---

## Step 1 -- Understand the problem

Before talking about the product, make clear:

- which problem is being solved;
- for whom this problem exists;
- why it deserves to be solved now.

If the problem is not clear, the product will not be either.

---

## Step 2 -- Define the product

Now, define the product.

Answer objectively:

- what this product is;
- which problem it solves;
- what it is not;
- which problems it **does not** try to solve.

This definition avoids early scope expansion.

---

## Step 3 -- Map the functions involved

Identify the functions needed to create the product, for example:

- product definition;
- prioritization;
- rule validation;
- execution;
- impact evaluation.

The execution function appears to indicate responsibility, but execution itself is outside the scope of this playbook.

Do not think about job titles or people. Think about responsibilities.

---

## Step 4 -- Record initial decisions

Some decisions must be recorded early, such as:

- initial scope;
- target audience;
- important constraints;
- success criteria.

These decisions create the base for everything that comes next.

---

## Step 5 -- Define initial rules and constraints

Define simple rules, such as:

- criteria to accept new ideas;
- scope constraints;
- technical or business restrictions.

A few clear rules are enough at the start.

---

## Step 6 -- Evaluate impacts before moving forward

Before moving to execution, evaluate:

- which functions are impacted;
- which risks exist;
- what happens if nothing is done;
- whether any rule or constraint is broken.

This analysis avoids impulsive decisions.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

When using AI in product creation:

- provide the product definition as context;
- inform rules and constraints already defined;
- ask for analysis and suggestions, not final decisions;
- always review based on the models.

AI supports the process, but does not replace judgment.

---

## What to avoid when using this playbook

Avoid:

- treating the playbook as a rigid checklist;
- moving forward without problem clarity;
- recording vague decisions;
- using AI without context;
- skipping impact analysis.

If something feels confusing, go back one step.

---

## In essence

This playbook serves to:

- organize reasoning in product creation;
- avoid common errors from the start;
- maintain coherence between decisions;
- support people and AI in the same context.

Creating a product does not need to be chaotic. But it also does not need to be rigid.
