# Introduction to Logical Enterprise Playbooks

Up to this point, Logical Enterprise was presented as concept, usage, and models. From this point on, we enter the **playbooks**.

This document exists to explain the role of playbooks, when to use them, and what to expect from them.

## What is a playbook in Logical Enterprise

In Logical Enterprise, a playbook is a **practical guide for application**.

It exists to:

- help apply the model day to day;
- guide recurring situations;
- reduce improvisation without direction;
- maintain coherence in application.

Playbooks are not fixed rules. They are **practical references**.

---

## What a playbook is not

A playbook is **not**:

- a rigid process;
- a mandatory manual;
- a fixed sequence of steps;
- a substitute for thinking.

If a playbook becomes rigid, it has lost its function.

---

## Why playbooks are needed

Even with good models, practical application can vary a lot.

Playbooks help to:

- turn concepts into action;
- reduce common errors;
- speed up recurring decisions;
- make use easier for new people;
- support conscious use of AI.

They work as learning shortcuts.

---

## When to use a playbook

Use a playbook when:

- the same situation repeats;
- similar errors happen;
- decisions take longer than they should;
- new people need reference;
- AI needs practical context.

If the situation is unique, a playbook may not be necessary.

---

## Playbooks do not replace models

Models explain **how to think**. Playbooks help **how to apply**.

A playbook always relies on one or more models. If a playbook ignores the models, it breaks company logic.

---

## General playbook structure

Although each playbook is different, they usually answer:

- in which situation to use it;
- which problem it helps solve;
- which models apply;
- which cautions to take;
- which mistakes to avoid.

It is not a fixed step by step. It is a reference guide.

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

For AI, playbooks help to:

- understand application context;
- suggest more appropriate actions;
- avoid generic answers;
- respect company logic.

Playbooks make AI more useful day to day.

---

## Simplicity as a principle

A good playbook:

- is easy to understand;
- is easy to follow;
- is easy to adapt.

If it became complex, it needs simplification.

---

## In essence

Playbooks exist to:

- turn the model into practice;
- support recurring decisions;
- reduce improvisation without direction;
- maintain coherence in application.

They do not command. They **help**.
