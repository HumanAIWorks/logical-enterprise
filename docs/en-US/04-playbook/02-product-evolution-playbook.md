# Product Evolution Playbook

This playbook shows how to apply Logical Enterprise to the **evolution of an existing product**, avoiding impulsive changes, side effects, and loss of coherence.

It is not for "optimize for the sake of optimizing". It is for **evaluating before changing**.

---

## When to use this playbook

Use this playbook when:

- a product already exists and needs to evolve;
- many improvement suggestions arise;
- changes start to generate side effects;
- past decisions are being questioned;
- AI is being used to suggest changes.

If the product does not exist yet, use the [Product Creation Playbook](01-product-creation-playbook.md).

---

## The problem this playbook solves

In product evolution, it is common to:

- change something without remembering why it was done that way;
- break rules without noticing;
- solve one problem by creating others;
- lose product identity over time;
- use AI to suggest changes out of context.

This playbook exists to avoid these problems.

---

## Overview of the reasoning

Evolving a product requires a different reasoning than creating it.

The general logic is:

1. Understand the current state of the product.
2. Retrieve existing decisions, rules, and constraints.
3. Define what really needs to change.
4. Evaluate impacts before changing.
5. Record new decisions.
6. Update rules, if needed.

This is not a fixed process. It is a **logical order of thinking**.

---

## Step 1 -- Understand the product as it is today

Before proposing changes, make clear:

- what the product is today;
- which problem it currently solves;
- for whom it exists;
- which limitations are already known.

Avoid assumptions. Use what is documented.

---

## Step 2 -- Retrieve decisions, rules, and constraints

Check:

- decisions that defined the product;
- rules that guide changes;
- constraints that cannot be broken.

If something is not documented, that is a warning sign.

---

## Step 3 -- Define what needs to change

Now be specific:

- what exactly needs to change?
- which problem does this change solve?
- is it a fix, an improvement, or an expansion?

Avoid generic changes like "improve the experience".

---

## Step 4 -- Evaluate impacts of the change

Before changing anything, evaluate:

- which functions are impacted;
- which rules or constraints can be affected;
- technical, business, or usage risks;
- positive and negative impacts.

If the impact is large, reduce scope or reassess.

---

## Step 5 -- Record new decisions

Every relevant change creates a decision.

Record:

- what was decided;
- why it was decided;
- what changes from that point on;
- how it relates to prior decisions.

This avoids confusing reviews in the future.

---

## Step 6 -- Update rules and constraints (if needed)

If the change alters product behavior:

- review existing rules;
- create new rules if needed;
- record exceptions explicitly.

Do not leave rules implicit.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

When using AI to evolve a product:

- provide existing decisions and rules;
- ask for impact analysis of the change;
- request alternatives, not only solutions;
- validate suggestions based on real context.

AI helps you think. The decision remains human.

---

## What to avoid when using this playbook

Avoid:

- changing without understanding the current state;
- ignoring prior decisions;
- breaking constraints "temporarily";
- using AI as a final source of decision;
- accumulating changes without record.

Evolution without context becomes regression.

---

## In essence

This playbook serves to:

- evolve products consciously;
- preserve coherence over time;
- avoid side effects;
- keep decisions connected.

Products evolve better when logic evolves with them.

Now that product evolution is clear, the next step is to understand **how to handle conflicts and hard decisions**.
