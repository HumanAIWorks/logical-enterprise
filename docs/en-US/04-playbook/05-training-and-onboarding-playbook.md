# Training and Onboarding Playbook

This playbook shows how to use Logical Enterprise to **train people and integrate new people**, without depending only on verbal explanations or informal knowledge.

It exists to make company understanding **faster, more consistent, and reusable**.

---

## When to use this playbook

Use this playbook when:

- new people join the company;
- partners need to understand how the company works;
- the same type of explanation repeats many times;
- decisions and rules are not easily understood;
- AI is used to support training and learning.

If the company does not grow or does not onboard new people, this playbook can be used occasionally.

---

## The problem this playbook solves

Without structure, training and onboarding tend to generate:

- excessive dependence on specific people;
- different explanations for the same thing;
- delay for new people to gain autonomy;
- knowledge loss over time;
- superficial AI use for learning.

This playbook exists to avoid these problems.

## Overview of the reasoning

In Logical Enterprise, training someone is not just teaching tasks.

It is helping the person understand:

- how the company thinks;
- how decisions are made;
- which rules must be respected;
- where the constraints are.

The general reasoning is:

1. Present the company logic.
2. Show functions and responsibilities.
3. Explain decisions, rules, and constraints.
4. Contextualize the person's role.
5. Give access to living documentation.

---

## Step 1 -- Present Logical Enterprise

Start by explaining:

- what Logical Enterprise is;
- why it exists;
- how it helps day to day;
- how documentation should be used.

This creates alignment before talking about tasks.

---

## Step 2 -- Show functions, not job titles

Present:

- which functions exist in the company;
- how they relate;
- which functions the person performs;
- which functions they do not perform.

This avoids confusion from the start.

---

## Step 3 -- Explain decisions, rules, and constraints

Help the person understand:

- important decisions already made;
- rules that guide work;
- constraints that cannot be crossed.

Without this, autonomy becomes risk.

---

## Step 4 -- Contextualize the person's role

Make clear:

- how their work impacts the whole;
- which functions they relate to;
- when they should consult other functions;
- when they can decide alone.

Autonomy without context creates errors.

---

## Step 5 -- Use documentation as a continuous base

Make sure the person knows:

- where the documentation is;
- how to consult decisions and rules;
- how to suggest changes;
- how to record new decisions.

Documentation is not one time reading. It is a constant reference.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

AI can support training by:

- answering questions based on documentation;
- generating explanations in different formats;
- simulating decision scenarios;
- helping review understanding.

Always using Logical Enterprise as context.

---

## What to avoid when training people

Avoid:

- explaining everything only verbally;
- assuming "the person will understand over time";
- skipping rules and constraints at the start;
- relying on individual memory;
- using AI without company context.

Training without structure creates noise.

---

## In essence

This playbook serves to:

- speed up company understanding;
- reduce dependence on key people;
- maintain coherence during growth;
- support continuous learning.

People work better when they understand the whole.

Now that training and onboarding are clear, the next step is to understand **how to govern and evolve Logical Enterprise over time**.
