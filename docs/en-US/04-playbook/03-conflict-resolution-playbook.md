# Conflict Resolution Playbook

This playbook shows how to use Logical Enterprise to deal with **real conflicts**, without personalizing the problem and without turning decisions into disputes.

It does not exist to "win arguments". It exists to **restore clarity**.

---

## When to use this playbook

Use this playbook when:

- areas conflict frequently;
- decisions get stuck due to disagreement;
- arguments become personal;
- rules are interpreted in different ways;
- AI generates conflicting answers depending on context.

If there is no real conflict, this playbook is not necessary.

---

## The problem this playbook solves

In conflicts, it is common to:

- discuss opinions instead of decisions;
- mix power with responsibility;
- ignore existing rules and constraints;
- decide based on who speaks louder;
- use AI to "reinforce one side".

This playbook exists to avoid these behaviors.

---

## Overview of the reasoning

In Logical Enterprise, conflicts are treated as **structure problems**, not people problems.

The general reasoning is:

1. Identify the real conflict.
2. Separate people from functions.
3. Check existing decisions, rules, and constraints.
4. Evaluate impacts of the options.
5. Record the resolution.

This does not eliminate conflicts. It makes them solvable.

---

## Step 1 -- Identify the real conflict

Before discussing solutions, make clear:

- which decision is disputed;
- which functions are involved;
- what is truly being questioned.

Avoid vague phrases like "we do not agree".

---

## Step 2 -- Separate people from functions

Identify:

- which functions are represented;
- which responsibilities each function has;
- who is speaking on behalf of which function.

This reduces personalization of the conflict.

---

## Step 3 -- Check decisions, rules, and constraints

Consult:

- decisions already made related to the topic;
- rules that guide this type of decision;
- constraints that cannot be crossed.

Many conflicts are solved here.

---

## Step 4 -- Evaluate impacts of the options

If there are still valid alternatives, evaluate:

- impacts on the product or service;
- impacts on other functions;
- short and long term risks;
- consequences of not deciding.

This shifts the discussion to facts.

---

## Step 5 -- Resolve and record

After choosing a path:

- record the decision made;
- make the reason clear;
- indicate which rules or constraints were reinforced or changed;
- communicate objectively.

Conflicts resolved without record tend to return.

---

## Use with Artificial Intelligence

AI can help to:

- list possible impacts;
- point out logical conflicts;
- suggest coherent alternatives;
- review consistency with existing rules.

AI should not be used to choose sides.

---

## What to avoid when using this playbook

Avoid:

- discussing without defining the conflict;
- skipping rule and constraint verification;
- turning conflict into a personal dispute;
- using AI as an authority argument;
- ending without a record.

Poorly resolved conflicts come back stronger.

---

## In essence

This playbook serves to:

- treat conflicts in a structured way;
- reduce wear between people;
- preserve coherence of the whole;
- turn disagreement into decision.

Conflict is not failure. Lack of structure is.
