# Artificial Intelligence Use Playbook

This playbook shows how to use Artificial Intelligence **as real support**, not as a replacement for people or decisions.

It exists to turn AI into a **reasoning partner**, aligned with company logic.

---

## When to use this playbook

Use this playbook when:

- AI is used frequently in daily work;
- AI answers vary or contradict each other;
- suggestions ignore business rules;
- decisions depend on the prompt of the moment;
- it is hard to maintain context over time.

If AI is used only occasionally, this playbook may not be necessary.

---

## The problem this playbook solves

Without structure, AI use tends to generate:

- generic answers;
- contradictions between sessions;
- suggestions outside company context;
- decisions based on poorly framed prompts;
- the feeling that AI "does not understand the business".

This playbook exists to solve that.

## Overview of the reasoning

In Logical Enterprise, AI is not treated as a decision maker.

It acts as:

- analysis support;
- generator of alternatives;
- coherence reviewer;
- reasoning facilitator.

The general reasoning is:

1. Provide structured context.
2. Indicate the functions involved.
3. Present decisions, rules, and constraints.
4. Ask for analysis, not decision.
5. Review results in a human way.

---

## Step 1 -- Provide context before asking anything

Before making a request to AI, make clear:

- what the problem is;
- in what context the decision exists;
- which product or service is involved;
- what the current state is.

Without context, AI assumes.

---

## Step 2 -- Inform functions, decisions, rules, and constraints

Whenever possible, inform:

- which functions are involved;
- decisions already made;
- rules that must be respected;
- constraints that cannot be crossed.

This completely changes the quality of the response.

---

## Step 3 -- Ask for analysis, not decision

Prefer requests like:

- "evaluate possible impacts";
- "list risks and alternatives";
- "point out inconsistencies";
- "suggest options within these constraints".

Avoid requests like:

- "decide the best path";
- "choose for us".

The decision remains human.

---

## Step 4 -- Review and validate the answers

After the AI response:

- validate based on Logical Enterprise;
- check against rules and constraints;
- adjust the request if needed;
- record important decisions.

AI without review becomes improvisation.

---

## Step 5 -- Use documentation as AI memory

Whenever possible:

- reuse recorded decisions as context;
- point to documented rules and constraints;
- avoid explaining everything from scratch every time.

Logical Enterprise works as a reliable external memory.

---

## Examples of healthy AI use

AI can help to:

- analyze impacts before deciding;
- generate coherent alternatives;
- review decisions already made;
- identify logical conflicts;
- support team training.

Always within clear constraints.

---

## What to avoid when using AI

Avoid:

- using AI without context;
- blindly trusting answers;
- asking for final decisions;
- ignoring existing rules;
- treating AI as authority.

AI without direction amplifies chaos.

---

## In essence

This playbook serves to:

- make AI use consistent;
- reduce generic answers;
- align AI with company logic;
- support human decisions.

AI expands capacity. Responsibility remains human.
